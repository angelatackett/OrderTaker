# OrderTaker

This is a Java program called "OrderTaker" that takes user inputs for a customer order and calculates the total cost after applying any discounts. The program uses a Scanner object to get user inputs and a DecimalFormat object to format output values.

The program prompts the user for the customer ID, unit price, quantity, product description, and discount in decimal format. It uses while loops to verify that the user inputs are of the correct data type (integer or double).

After obtaining the necessary inputs, the program calculates the subtotal by multiplying the unit price by the quantity. It then calculates the amount to be discounted and the total cost after the discount is applied. The program uses printf format method to format the output values and displays the order details to the user, including the subtotal, discount percentage, discounted amount, and total due.

The program closes the Scanner object after all inputs have been obtained and output values displayed.
